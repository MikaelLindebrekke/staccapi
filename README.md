# stacc-code-challenge-21
This is my answer to the Stacc coding challenge. 

## Exercise description
The challenge is to make a interface that interacts with an API. 
The main function of this application is part of a Know Your Customer check where you check to see if a person is poltically exposed. 

> My project will hopefully consist of an API and a interface that uses said API. I also want to host it on Herkou so that it can be run from anywhere.


## Comments
I have never made an API before so this is an interesting challenge. I started out in Java because that is what I am most familiar with and thought that would be a good place to start. 
I realized soon that what I was making was infact not an API but simply a interaction with the already supplied API from Stacc. 
So it was then back to the drawing board to see how to make an API and that lead me to Javascript and the Express framework for APIs. 
When making the API i got som good help from a friend showing me how the basics of an API should be made. With his help I was able to make a functioning API that I then can add a web interface on so that one can do full PEP check on a person. 

With the API functiontion I wanted to add a web page front to it so that it would work as a full application.
